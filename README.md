*FYI: Script is not functioning yet, still a WIP*

Periodically clears out your ad preferences & categories on Facebook by programmatically going through [this webpage](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/) and removing your interests & ads you've interacted with.

TODO:
* Set this up as a cronjob so it runs on a regular routine (once a night?)
* Spin the script into a full-fledged browser extension
